Welcome to the **AWS Cloud Security Virtual Event**

The **AWS Security Jam** is an event where participants experience a wide range of AWS services in a series of prepared scenarios that represent common use-cases and operational tasks. Through these challenges participants learn AWS best practices during a fun interactive event designed for all different levels of expertise. By completing the challenges the participants are learning how actually use AWS services to solve problems, but more importantly they are also learning the best practices associated to those services. However, just saying that you learning something is not enough. The Jam platform also validates that you completed the challenge correctly and then also compares how participants did on the challenge against all other participants that attempted the challenge.

The video below introduces you to the event and how to use the jam platform. Please watch the video below, check-in on the Go to Webinar session to find today's secret key and get started at the [Jam Platform](https://jam.awsevents.com/).
