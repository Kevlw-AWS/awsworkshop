The AWS Cloud Security Virtual event aims to improve your cloud security skills through a series of guided workshops, Security JAM scenario challenges and on-demand talks. In this portal you will find the following:

  - [Workshops](#workshops) 
  - [On-Demand Tracks](#on-demand-tracks)   
 
## Workshops

These workshops are designed to help you get familiar with AWS Security and Operational services so you can improve your security and compliance objectives. You'll be working with services such as AWS Systems Manager (operational management), AWS Config (configuration change management), Amazon Inspector (vulnerability & behavior analysis) and AWS WAF (web application firewall). 

At the start of each workshop you will be able to watch a short video that will provide you an overview and a real world example.

| Topic | Description | Time        |
|-----------|---------|---------|
|[Data Discovery and Classification with Macie](/workshops/module1) | This workshop is designed to help you get familiar with Amazon Macie and learn how to scan and classify data in your S3 buckets. You will be working with Amazon Macie (data classification) and AWS Security Hub (centralized security view) to view and understand how data in your environment in stored and to understand any changes in S3 bucket policies that may negatively affect your security posture. You will learn to create a custom data identifier and how to create and scope data discovery and classification jobs in Amazon Macie. Finally you will use Amazon Macie to filter and investigate the results from the scans that you created. | 1 - 2 hours |
|[Threat detection and response in AWS](/workshops/module2)| This workshop is designed to help you get familiar with AWS Security services and learn how to use them to identify and remediate threats in your environment. You'll be working with services such as Amazon GuardDuty (threat detection), Amazon Inspector (vulnerability & behavior analysis), AWS Security Hub (centralized security view). | 1 - 2  hours |
|[Encrypt the Spoilers](/workshops/module3)| AWSome films stores its movie spoilers in an S3 bucket where the objects are not encrypted, so they can be seen by anyone. These spoilers need to be encrypted to prevent ruining the films plot twists. | 2 - 3 hours |
|[Architecting for PCI DSS Compliance](/workshops/module4)| This challenge provides an environment that must be re-architected to meet PCI DSS compliance. The output of the CloudFormation template provides a status URL that should be checked for realtime status of compliance. Once all issues have been remediated, the answer key will be revealed on the status web site. |  1 hour |
|[Keep your secrets a secret](/workshops/module5)| Your business is growing and new customers are flocking to the site everyday. The Customer database has lots of sensitive data and the password to the database is no longer a secret. We need to address this immediately! |  1 hour |
|[Sleeper Agent](/workshops/module6)| An attacker got hold of a pair of access/secret keys from Github and got into your AWS account. GuardDuty detected the intrusion and raised an unauthorized credential exfiltration alert. The compromised credentials were quickly identified. You immediately deactivated the stolen keys and disabled the compromised account. Breathing a sigh of relief, you felt like you fought off this attack. |  1 hour |


## On-Demand Tracks

Watch great talks about AWS cloud security, presented by a mix of AWS customers and AWS experts.

| Topic | Description | Skill Level |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| [Introduction to AWS Security](/ondemandtracks/intro-to-aws-sec)| Ensuring security and compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. In this session, we introduce the AWS Shared Responsibility Model along with key security services that allow you to build security controls that are aligned to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework categories: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. You also hear from a financial institution in Singapore about how they are developing a cloud security strategy that allows innovation within defined risk guardrails. | 100 | 
| [Advanced container security](/ondemandtracks/advanced_container_security)| Learn how to leverage the identity and authorisation, network security and secrets management features of the wider AWS platform for their containers, including Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS). We also discuss best practices for the security of your container images such as scanning them for known vulnerabilities. | 300 | 
| [Cloud security for everyone: Multi-account strategy](/ondemandtracks/cloud_security_multi_account)| The cloud enables every business to have enterprise-grade security. Leveraging multiple accounts is an essential security pattern, even in small teams without dedicated security personnel. In this session, we dive deep into the accounts and learn how to configure them. Attendees are expected to have an understanding of the shared responsibility model and IAM. | 300 | 
| [Cloud-enabled security evolution with Origin Energy](/ondemandtracks/cloud-enabled_security_origin)|Moving your business to the cloud is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to significantly evolve your security capability and culture. Origin Energy, Australia’s largest energy retailer, started its cloud journey a few years ago. In this session, Origin Energy’s chief security officer and its security lead for cloud discuss their experience transforming a largely outsourced security capability into an in-house, business-aligned team. Learn how the company builds and runs cloud-native security at scale, at low cost, and with improved security. | 200 | 
| [Federated access and authorisation made simple](/ondemandtracks/federated_access_made_simple)| In this session, learn how to implement attribute-based access control with role-based access control. We discuss how you can use this strategy to ensure that people have the right access to the things they need in their role, and we show you how to simplify their IAM policies in the process. Also learn how automation can deliver the consistency of access and authorisation, and how you can apply this to your environment. | 200 | 
| [How AFL secures real-time player tracking with encryption](/ondemandtracks/secure_real-time_tracking_afl)| Through the sharing of real-time data and insights about the prevailing game and players, fan engagement in sports has been revolutionised. However, the sensitivity, influence, and impact of such data, as determined by various entities in the sports ecosystem, is critical. In this session, discover how a highly secure application has been designed and implemented not only to appease the various sporting entities, but also to ensure data is kept secure. | 300 | 
| [How to put SecOps to work in your organisation](/ondemandtracks/secops_in_your_organization)| Open Universities Australia (OUA) migrated their core business systems to AWS in 2014 and have continued to optimise their environment on AWS. Leveraging AWS tools, OUA have automated responses to security events, limiting intervention of engineering staff, and enabling secure self-service tasks to simplify access to secure systems. In this session, OUA covers what worked, what didn't, and what they learned along the way. | 200 | 
| [How Xinja built a neobank on the cloud](/ondemandtracks/neoband_in_th_cloud_xinja)| Xinja is a 100-percent digital cloud-based neobank composed of a microservices architecture built with Kubernetes and Apache Kafka on AWS and hooked into many modern, cloud-based banking, payment, and channel platforms. This session focuses on how Xinja built its technology stack to exceed stringent security, risk, and resiliency requirements. Learn how it established a contemporary cloud network foundation, delivered transaction and deposit accounts with debit card payment capability, and integrated Apple Pay and Google Pay (including PCI DSS compliance). Additionally, hear how Xinja created multiple on-demand data pipelines and worked with APRA to secure its banking license and revolutionise its customers’ banking experience. | 300 | 
| [The fundamentals of AWS Security](/ondemandtracks/security_fundamentals)| AWS offers an ever-growing landscape of services designed for a wide range of workloads in the cloud.
