For this workshop you will address the audit concerns using [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) and [AWS Config Conformance packs](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/introducing-aws-config-conformance-packs/)  
 
 There are three buckets that we are focusing our efforts on today.  Each bucket is named and tagged based on its classification level.  

{{% notice note %}}
The public bucket is not shared publicly but contains information classified as public.
