All of the guidance to this point has been focused on the technology configuration that you can implement. The last piece of advice, “be involved in the dev cycle,” is about people, and can be broadly summarized as “raise the security culture of your organization.” The role of people in all parts of the organization is to help the business launch their solutions securely. As people focused on security, we can guide and educate the rest of our organization to understand what they need to do to raise the bar for security in everything they build. Security is everyone’s job — not just for those folks with it in their job title.

What the security people in every organization can do is to make security easier, by shifting the process to make the easiest and most desirable action one that is almost the most secure. For example, each team should not build their own identity federation or logging solution. We are stronger when we work together, and this applies to securing the cloud as well. The goal is to make security more approachable so that co-workers want to talk to the security team because they know it is the place to get help.
