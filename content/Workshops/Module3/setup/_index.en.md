In this first module you will be configuring your environment to be ready for encrypting the spoilers.  You will be running one CloudFormation template which will automate the creation of S3 bucket, the unencrypted spoiler S3 bucket and creating the KMS key that Clinton has created (which he has not granted you access to).

**Agenda**
 
1. Run the initial CloudFormation Template â€“ 5 min
2. Verify the account inventory - 2 min



## Deploy the AWS CloudFormation template

To initiate the scenario and configure your environment you will need to run the  CloudFormation template:
