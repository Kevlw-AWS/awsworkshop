When AWS needs to contact you about your [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/security/aws-secure-account-setup/), we use the contact information defined in the AWS Management Console, including the email address used to create the account and those listed under Alternate Contacts. You should also have a process for regularly checking that these email addresses work, and that you are responding to emails—especially security notifications you might receive from abuse@amazon.com.

Please note that you will need *Root Account Access* in order to edit your alternate contacts. 

### Lab Steps
1. Sign in to your AWS Console. 
2. Click on the arrow next to your account to expand the following drop down options. 
3.  Select “My Account”.

4. Scroll down until your find “Alternate Contacts”. Edit your alternate contacts to ensure that the right teams are notified for Billing, Operations and Security. All email addresses should be set up to go to aliases that are not dependent on a single person.
