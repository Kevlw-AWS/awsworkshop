**How do I sign-on to Jam?**

All of today’s sessions are through the AWS Jam platform at https://jam.aws.events.com/. If you have played an AWS jam before use your existing account otherwise register for a new one. The secret key for today’s event is available in the Go To Webinar session.

**I’ve played before but forgot my password, how do I reset it?**

Forgot password is self-service at https://jam.awsevents.com/forgot-password. 

**I haven’t received my verification or password reset email**

Check your spam folder and make sure you have entered the correct email address. You can validate this by attempting to sign up again - if you previously signed up you will be prevented from doing so again. Try resetting your password at https://jam.awsevents.com/forgot-password. 

**What’s the User name / password to access the AWS Console? What region should my Jam be in?**

Each team is setup with a separate account for each challenge they compete in. You can access your account through the console or CLI using buttons in the top right of the challenge page. If the challenge requires SSH access your key will be available there too. Your account number and the region your challenge is deployed in is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

**The page doesn’t seem to load or I’m having issues with the Jam website**

We currently recommend Chrome or Firefox for use with the Jam. We cannot guarantee support on IE or Edge. Also ensure any extensions that block content such as adblock allow content to load on the AWS Jam platform.

**I’m stuck with this challenge, help!**

A number of unlockable clues are available to help guide you through each challenge. If you are still stuck hit the “Need more Help?” on the challenge overview page.
