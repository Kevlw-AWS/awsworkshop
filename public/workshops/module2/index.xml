      <description>Lab Setup In this part of the lab you will set up the necessary resources in your environment to proceed with the Systems Manager labs.
Create an EC2 Key Pair   Use your administrator account to access the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
In 2019 the EC2 console was updated to have a consistent look and feel with other AWS Services, and to improve the user experience. This lab guide shows the new and improved console experience.</description>

      <description>Operations as Code with Systems Manager  In a traditional environment you would have to set up the systems and software to perform administration activities. You would require a server to execute your scripts. You would need to manage authentication credentials across all of your systems.
Operations as code reduces the resources, time, risk, and complexity of performing operations tasks and ensures consistent execution. You can take operations as code and automate operations activities by using scheduling and event triggers.</description>

      <description>State Manager with Systems Manager  KEY CONCEPT: AWS Systems Manager - State Manager In State Manager, an association is the result of binding configuration information that defines the state you want your instances to be in to the instances themselves. This information specifies when and how you want instance-related operations to run that ensure your Amazon EC2 and hybrid infrastructure is in an intended or consistent state.
An association defines the state you want to apply to a set of targets.</description>
